$Header$

This directory contains code for Hermite polynomial interpolation.

makefile
	This has targets to create the subdirectories for the
	Maple-generated coefficient files, and to run Maple to
	generated those files.

make.code.defn
	This tells the Cactus build system which files to compile.

[123]d.maple
	These files contain the Maple code to generate the interpolation
	coefficients.

fns.maple
	These files define the interpolation functions, coefficients, etc,
	for the Maple code in [123]d.maple

[123]d.cube.order?.smooth?.c
	These files are the individual cases for the interpolation.
	Each file defines a separate function.  Each file just #defines
	a bunch of macros, then #includes "../template.c" to get the
	actual interpolation code.  Unfortunately, the ISO C standard
	only guarantees 31 characters for function names (in fact, it
	doesn't even guarantee that for external names -- they may be
	limited by a system linker -- but I quietly ignore that and
	assume I can use 31), so the functions are named in a cryptic
	manner (described in ../Lagrange-tensor-product/README).

all_prototypes.h
	This file contains C prototypes for each of the functions
	in [123]d.cube.order?.smooth0.c.
